# Perseverance LMST Time Plugin Example

This is a demonstration of a more complex time plugin for the Aerie UI. This time plugin implements Perseverance LMST time as the primary time for the Aerie UI as well as additional time formats in SCLK and UTC. This plugin is built using Typescript and bundled using Rollup.js to output a `time-plugin.js` file along with some other associated files that the plugin will dynamically fetch at runtime. Mars time conversions are performed using [TimeCraftJS](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/timecraftjs) which provides an interface to a version of NAIF CSPICE that is compiled to Javascript using Emscripten. This plugin and the provided SPICE kernels are specific to the Perseverance rover so it is recommended that users make a copy of this plugin and customize it for their own needs.
